delta.jpg is an jpg image of a talk board from BSidesSF 2018.
A copy of it has been modified and embedded into itself as an EXIF thumbnail. When you compare the two images you find a black line on the board has been turned into a barcode.

The barcode is code-128 and when decoded results in the flag.
